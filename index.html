                                I'm a Front End Engineer based in Odessa ‚òÄÔ∏è. I describe myself as a passionate developer who loves coding, open source, and the web platform ‚ù§Ô∏è.

                            Aside from my job, I like to create and contribute to open source projects. That helps me to learn a ton of new stuff, grow as a developer and support other open source projects. Also I enjoy writing different things ‚úçÔ∏è at my blog.
                            
                            In my free time you can find me longboarding üõπ , at the gym üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, at the beach üèñ or on tech meetups and conferences around Ukraine and Europe.

                    Among the specific ways our work could respond, empowered by love: urging faculty to maintain high academic standards while assuring all students they belong and can thrive in academia, while remaining empathic and attentive to current affairs; developing programming and services rooted in asset based, culturally responsive frameworks (as in Rend√≥n et al., 2014); and collaborating on ambitious programmatic efforts like the City College of New York‚Äôs Beyond Identity program, which aims to give students the power to effect social change and advocate for themselves, ‚Äúto take young people with direct experience of injustice and clear ideas of how to redress injustice and let them speak to these issues‚Äù (Boudreau, in Gluckman, 2017, my emphasis).

                <p class="center-text">Philosophy allows people to open their minds and discover what is truly important in life. Therefore, it is accurate to state that people who do not involve themselves in philosophical thought cannot be truly happy. Philosophy is necessary to live a 'good' life.
